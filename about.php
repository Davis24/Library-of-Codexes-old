As an avid videogamer I have always wanted an easier way to read in-game codexes thus, a library.<br><br> The archives include codexes (which is an overarching term to include all text), authors, curated collections, and even ebooks so you can take your reading on the go.  </p>        </div>

Yuck. <br><br> Did you know there are over 300 books in Elder Scrolls: Skyrim alone? It's rough but I'm constantly working on expanding the collection so check back often!</p>
